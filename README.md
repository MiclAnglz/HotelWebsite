# HotelWebsite
WSD Major Project - ASP.NET, Bootstrap, Razor, C#, SQLite

<strong>Task: </strong> This project is to build a website for the fictitious Western Inn that serves the visitors to WSU, as well as the public. This website should allow guests to search and book rooms, and allow administrators to offer discounts to university visitors and view statistics, etc.

<strong>Special Notes:</strong>

- A more detailed description of the task can be found in the "ProjectBrief" folder.

- This project was to be completed with a group, however; one of the group members completed the whole project by himself. The project in this repo is my version of the project that I completed myself.
