# Hotel Website
WSD Major Project - ASP.NET, Bootstrap, Razor, C#, SQLite

<strong>Task: </strong> The objective of this project was to construct a website for the fictional Hotel (Western Inn). The envisioned website aims to provide guests with the ability to effortlessly explore room options, make reservations, and facilitate administrators to apply discounts on rooms and provide statistical insights.

<strong>Notes:</strong>

- A more detailed description of the project task can be found in the "ProjectBrief" folder.

- This project was a group project; however, the project in this repo is my version of the project that I completed myself. From start to finish.
  
<strong>Addional Features Added:</strong>

- Developed dynamic charts and graphs to enrich the Statistics page.

- Crafted a bespoke view template by extracting data from the "Booking" table in SQLite. This template integrates the records into the site's Statistics page. Notably, the statistics module captures the monthly booking count and supports convenient year-based filtering, accessible through admin login credentials.  <strong><i>(admin login)</i></strong>

- Created a search bar on the "Manage Bookings" page to filter out records. The search is also not case or word sensitive.

- The date entries are also fully valitdated so the user can not enter a date before todays date.
