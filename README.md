# Hotel Website
WSD Major Project - ASP.NET, Bootstrap, Razor, C#, SQLite

<strong>Task: </strong> This project is to build a website for the fictitious Western Inn that serves the visitors to WSU, as well as the public. This website should allow guests to search and book rooms, and allow administrators to offer discounts to university visitors and view statistics, etc.

<strong>Notes:</strong>

- A more detailed description of the project task can be found in the "ProjectBrief" folder.

- This project was to be completed with a group, however; one of the group members completed the whole project by himself. The project in this repo is my version of the project that I completed myself.
  
<strong>Addional Features Added:</strong>

- Created dynamic charts and graphs for the Statistics page.

- Created a custom view template from the "Booking" table in SQLite and implmented the records in the statistics page of the site. The stat caputures the number of bookings per month and can be filtered by year.  <i>(admin login)</i>
