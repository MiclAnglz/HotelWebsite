# Hotel Website
WSD Major Project - ASP.NET, Bootstrap, Razor, C#, SQLite

<strong>Task: </strong> This project is to build a website for the fictitious Western Inn that serves the visitors to WSU, as well as the public. This website should allow guests to search and book rooms, and allow administrators to offer discounts to university visitors and view statistics, etc.

<strong>Special Notes:</strong>

- A more detailed description of the task can be found in the "ProjectBrief" folder.

- This project was to be completed with a group, however; one of the group members completed the whole project by himself. The project in this repo is my version of the project that I completed myself.

<strong>Additional Features:</strong>

- Created a custom view table in SQLite and implmented the records for a statistic that displays the number of bookings per month which can be filtered by year. Table records and charts are also dynamic and will change depending on the records that are saved in thhe database
